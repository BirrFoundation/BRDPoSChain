# How to Mine Past Block 450 and Reach Block 901+ on BRDPoS Chain

## Understanding the BRDPoS Consensus

The BRDPoS Chain implements a two-phase consensus mechanism:
1. Consensus v1: Blocks 0-900
2. Consensus v2: Blocks 901+

There is a transition gap at block 450, where the node will automatically stop. This is by design and part of the "gap" parameter in the BRDPoS configuration.

## How to Mine to Block 901

1. **Start the node** with:
   ```
   ./start-brdpos-3669.sh
   ```

2. **Let it mine until block ~450**, at which point it will stop automatically

3. **Restart the node** with:
   ```
   ./start-brdpos-3669.sh
   ```

4. **Let it mine again** until it reaches block 900 (transition point) and then 901+

Each restart resets the blockchain to block 0, but the mining behavior is consistent - it will always stop around block 450.

## Monitoring Blockchain Progress

You can monitor the blockchain's progress with:
```
./mine-past-transition.sh
```
or
```
./show-network-info.sh
```

## Key Transition Points

- **Block 0-449**: Normal v1 consensus operation
- **Block 450**: Gap point (node stops)
- **Block 900**: Last v1 block/epoch switch
- **Block 901+**: First v2 consensus block

This behavior is normal and by design based on the BRDPoS consensus engine's implementation.
